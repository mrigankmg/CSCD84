________________________________________________

Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (5 marks) Explain the design of your utility function.
     Describe all the factors that influence its value, and
     how their influence was evaluated and integrated into
     a single, meaningful value. Convince us that your utility
     makes sense!

2 .- (2 marks) Ignoring computation time, what is the effect of
     search depth (number of turns) on the chances of the mouse
     winning the game.

3 .- (2 marks) What situations will cause your mouse to lose?
     can these be fixed either with the utility function, or
     by changing the search depth? if so, how?

4 .- (2 marks) Compare cats with smartness=.8 against cats with
     smartness=1 - which are harder for your mouse to beat?
     why do you think that is?

5 .- (2 marks) Can the mouse be made unbeatable by having an
     optimal utility function?

6 .- (2 bonus marks) Could a human playing the game in place
      of the mouse do better than your code? (yes, no, and
      a reasonable explanation of why)

working partially, briefly describe what works, what
doesn't work, or what problems exist.

Marking:

(10 marks) Implemented a non-trivial, clever, and
           effective utility function. It allows the
           mouse to win the game often.

(10 marks) Correctly implementing MiniMax. The algorithm
           should produce the expected behaviour. The
           mouse should take a reasonable path to the
           cheese and avoid cats. The cats will try to
           catch the mouse. Mouse is not easy to catch.

(10 marks) Implemented alpha-beta pruning. The algorithm
           significantly reduces the amount of search
           while producing identical results as those
           from standard MiniMax

(15 marks) Competitive (TA assigned) based on how smart
           your mouse is (this is related to your
           utility function above!)
